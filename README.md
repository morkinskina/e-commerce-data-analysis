# E-commerce data analyzis

In this project, I analyzed the sales data of a UK-registered online store,
which contained all the transactions of this store for the period from 01-12-2009 to 09-12-2011.
From the description it follows that the company mainly sells various gifts, and many of its customers are wholesalers.
Publicly available e-commerce datasets are very rare, as their distribution is subject to many trade secret restrictions.
Therefore, I chose the dataset available for download at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
and on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data)
